# Dependency relationship

After creating identifiers and dependency items, you need to declare dependency relationship among dependencies. There are two types of dependency items that could dependent on others: class items and factory function items.

## On a class

To declare dependencies of a class, you could use the `Injector` decorator:

```ts highlight=3
class MapService {
  constructor(
    @Inject(SatelliteService) private readonly satellite: SatelliteService
  ) {}
}
```

or an `IdentifierDecorator`:

```ts highlight=7
interface IPlatformService {}

const IPlatformService = createIdentifier<IPlatformService>('platform')

class DialogService {
  constructor(
    @IPlatformService private readonly platformSrc: IPlatformService
  ) {}
}
```

## On a factory

You should list all its dependencies in the `deps` property:

```ts highlight=9
const item = [
  I18NNumberTranspiler,
  {
    useFactory: (i18nService: I18NService) => {
      return i18nService.isChinese()
        ? new ChineseNumberTranspiler()
        : new EnglishNumberTranspiler()
    },
    deps: [I18NService],
  },
]
```

## forwardRef

In the following example, `Person` is defined before `Father` but relies on `Father`. In this case, you should use `forwardRef` to wrap `Father`. Otherwise redi would receive `undefined` when tries to figure out dependencies of `Person` (and it would throw an error in that case).

```ts highlight=5,7
import { Self, SkipSelf } from '@wendellhu/redi'

class Person {
  constructor(
    @Self() @Inject(forwardRef(() => Father)) private readonly father: Father,
    @SkipSelf()
    @Inject(forwardRef(() => Father))
    private readonly grandfather: Father
  ) {}
}

class Man extends Person {}
class Father extends Man {
  changeDiaper(): void {}
}
```
