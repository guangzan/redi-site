# Multiple & optional injection

## Optional

When a dependency is not held by an injector, the injector would throw an error when you want to get that dependency.

```ts highlight=3,8
class MapService {
  constructor(
    @Inject(SatelliteService) private readonly satellite: SatelliteService
  ) {}
}

const injector = new Injector([[MapService]])
injector.get(MapService) // ERROR!
```

You could use `Optional` instead `Inject`, to mark `SatelliteService` as an optional dependency not a required one.

```ts highlight=3,8
class MapService {
  constructor(
    @Optional(SatelliteService) private readonly satellite?: SatelliteService
  ) {}
}

const injector = new Injector([MapService])
injector.get(MapService)
```

In this case, `MapService` could construct, but its property `satellite` would be undefined.

## Multiple

Similarly, you could use `Many` to mark the dependency could be injected with multiple instances:

```ts highlight=3,9-10
class MapService {
  constructor(
    @Many(ISatelliteService) private readonly satellites: ISatelliteService[]
  ) {}
}

const injector = new Injector([
  [MapService],
  [ISatelliteService, { useClass: GPSSatellite }],
  [ISatelliteService, { useClass: BeidouSatellite }],
])
injector.get(MapService)
```
